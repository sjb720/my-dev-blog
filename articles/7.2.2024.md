# Hello world!

Welcome to my programming blog. This is the first article. It's just a demo while I set up the website pipeline. This article is being read from a markdown file and parsed into tsx! (How cool âœ¨)

Since this mimics real markdown, I can write articles quickly and preview them before I push.

I can also write code blocks! Maybe I'll make an extension to let people quickly copy samples. Here's my crappy (but working) implementation of an in-place quicksort in rust.

```rust
fn partition(arr: &mut [i32], start: usize, end: usize) -> usize {
    let pivot = arr[end];
    let mut i = start;
    let mut k = start;
    let mut first_swap = true;
    while i < end {
        if arr[i] < pivot {
            // usize cannot be negative so we simulate our first swap
            if !first_swap {
                k += 1;
            } else {
                first_swap = false;
            }
            // Swap
            let temp = arr[k];
            arr[k] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
        i += 1;
    }
    // Swap pivot into final place.
    if !first_swap {
        k += 1;
    }
    arr[end] = arr[k];
    arr[k] = pivot;

    return k;
}

fn quicksort(arr: &mut [i32], start: usize, end: usize) {
    if start < end {
        let sorted_index = partition(arr, start, end);
        if sorted_index != 0 {
            quicksort(arr, start, sorted_index - 1);
        }
        quicksort(arr, sorted_index + 1, end);
    }
}
```

This is pretty ugly, it'd be cool to register languages in the future and have syntax colors show up like it does in my IDE.

Thanks for coming!
